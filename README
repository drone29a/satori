TODO

- decide how to approximate the best motion segment region to use as 
  the start window for CAMSHIFT
- assuming that feature points were used to choose the start window, 
  keep checking that the CAMSHIFT box contains a good percentage of the points, 
  otherwise may need to reset the track window
